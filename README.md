# whitman-markov
Generating Walt Whitman (and others) poetry using Markov chains

Made at the Recurse Center Fall 2018

## TODO
* ~~Add more poems to the corpus, trigrams have issues with a small dataset~~ (added Emily Dickinson)
* ~~Move to bigram model~~
* ~~Support newline and tab characters~~
* ~~Longer poems! Not single words~~
* Allow twitter users to choose a start word and the bot replies with a poem. Maybe reply with suggestions if they don't choose a word in the corpus?
